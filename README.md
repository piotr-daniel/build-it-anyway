# 🧠 Project Ideas No One Asked For

Welcome to the land of the unnecessary, the unprompted, and the unhinged.  
This is a collaborative collection of software project ideas that *no one* asked for — and that's exactly why you should build them.

Whether you're learning to code, prototyping for fun, or just bored and unhinged, you're invited to submit your quirkiest, most pointless, or strangely inspiring ideas.
